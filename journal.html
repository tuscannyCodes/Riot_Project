<h3>Become a "coder"</h3>

<p> What do I wish to gain from leaning how to code? I want a better chance at success. Im doing this so that I can have a valuble skill to help people with. So far, I can say that Im having fun. Im not sure how I will feel after I start getting deeper. I think in order to keep this fun for me, ill just have to focus on making cool things that keep my attention. I want to use this to make everyone sorry. I want to use this to help myself become sombody. I dont want this to, say take over my love that I have for creating art and things... I hope that once I start making money off of code, I will be able to fund the lifestyle that I want....</p>

<p> I mean, I guess a part of me is worried that in the process of learning code i'll become a "coder" rather than an artist... but I guess im looking at it as "hey you gotta work anyways,  why not choose to do code?" . I kinda feel like learning code is a way for me to fight back. Fight back against the bullshit that Ive been faced with in life. a way to get to where I need to be. Where I want to go. So I guess coding is a tool, or a vehicle. </p>

<p> Plus I like my new laptop and now I'll get to spend more time on it being productive instead of just watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPXC4VAxAi4" target="_blank"> Youtube videos.</a> </p>

<p>  I need to belive in myself. This isnt a bad thing. I can feel my brain trying to make this into a bad thing. <strong>This is good </strong>. This is me thinking outside of my box, this is me showing initiative. </p>


<h3> I can do this. I know I can. </h3>

<p>also, merry christmas.</p>

<h3>Im learning the basics</h3>

<p> Learning is going slow. I Feel like im making progress. Well, <em>I Know for a fact</em> that im making progress, but I guess you can say that im more so focused on how far I have to go. Im so hungry for progression at this point its almost umbearable. I want to get that job. Ive never been the patient type. But I want success thats all. Im tired of feeling helpless. So Im just hungry. But I know that I have to pace myself and not get burned out. Hell, Ive only been learning HTML for 2 days. But I just want to improve my life. 
</p>

<p> Its not that difficult yet. Im learning the basics. The formats and stuff. Some things are quite intuitive while others are not and im left wondering if people actually memorize this stuff. But its very intersting. I kinda looked a into CSS today and although it made a little sense, I have to admit it was intimidating. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfoY53QXEnI&t=2707s" target="_blank"> The hr long tutorial that I watched </a> was kinda gut wrenching because after all the coding that was discussed, the rudimentary adjustemnts and improvement to the code was.... unimpressive to say the least. I thought that CSS was supposed to make your conde stand out and look badass... but to me, it still looks like some boring text you would see on a government website. I know im jumping the gun here. I dont expect to be making the next big app by the end of the week. But I was just under the impression that CSS would make my stuff look better.  
</p>

<p> Anywho, I guess Im having fun and I suppose thats all that one can ask for at this point. Making text links and stuff is becoming understandable for me. The formating of HTML makes sense. I kinda can say I understand the structure. So theres that. Im just trying to get an understanding of how all of this becomes cool or practical. I need to keep learning. 
</p>

<p>
Im learning a bit more about code. I think its going pretty well. Im exited to start getting into CSS a bit more, but im also a little intimidated. I have a better understanding of how HTML works and how it is paired with CSS to make an attractive webpage. This makes me happy because I can see that my knowledge on the subject is progressing for sure.
</p>



<p>I got a book. <a href="https://medium.com/23codestreet/html-and-css-design-and-build-websites-by-jon-duckett-aef144cf232f" target="_b">HTML & CSS by Jon Duckett.</a> Really great book. I like how it lays things out very simply and easy to understand. The thing I still want to learn is how to make a horizontal header. I think this is kinda difficult for me because it is the first thing that will require me to use CSS. But I guess I will have to start somewhere. I also think I will start updating this site to make it look more attractive. Like formatting type stuff; not nessesarily style or anything. But yeah, so far its going well. Slow progress is better than no progress, and I want to make <em>sure</em> that I have a solid foundation.
</p>

<p>
	Another big thing that I really want to learn is how to properly use margins to enhance the layout of my pages. I need to have a better way to 'frame' the page. This is a bit of formatting but im not sure if this would be considered a "style" element that would best be executed is CSS or if this is an HTML type of deal. I think I will work on this first so that the page is more readable.

<p> 
Im getting a little better. Im working on structuring my life a little bit more so that I can be more cleaheaded and productive. Just doing basic things like giving myself mental space to work on something. Like scheduling out blocks to do things in my head if that makes sense... I wrote a schedule down too so that helps. IDK i just think that the whole locdown thing has started to wear on me a bit so in order to combat that, im working on building a more structured lifestyle.

Learning code is helping. I guess its giving me something structured to work on. Something organized. Right now im learning about CSS. I finally applied it to this site. Im happy to repor that CSS is not a difficult as I initially thought.  Its basically just taking elemants of HTML and creating rules for said elements. right now im working on mastering the layout portion. this part is kinda difficult. but Im sure after a few days of study ill have it down pack. I think that i may need to start over with a brand new site project and go from there just so I can keep my foundations sharp. But I pretty much got it. 

<h4> Things I need to preactice.</h4>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Creating tables</li>
		<li>HTML page formatting using CSS </li>
		<li>Continue learning the basics of CSS becore going deeper</li>
		<li>I want to learn more about <span class="bcolor">margins</span> <span class="dcolor">and</span> <span class="ccolor">spacing</span> <span class="ecolor">and stuff </span> </li>

	</ol>

	<p>I think it will be important for me to focus longer on the basics of CSS before moving on as to not confuse myslef. because unlike HTML,I think the CSS learning curve can ramp up pretty quickly. So Im going to take the next few days to just understand CSS and how it interacts with html. </p>

<h1> Jan22, 2021 </h1>
<p> Ive really taken these few days to study more with code. Im getting a better grasp of html and css. Its really helped me build a better foundation. Im learing how to deal with mistakes. Most of my trials and tribulations with css is syntax. I am seeing how the 'cascade' elemant works and how important it is to make sure brackets are closed and your code is neat. I really feel like i havent implemented much css in this website. I want to add more; but right now im still learning. Maybe after this week ill start doing some small projects and stuff to really test myself on what ive learned. <span class="hide"><a href="#">THATS A GREAT IDEA!</a></span>

<p>Im haveing a hard time with formatting. I think im going to re read the capter on formatting in the book. Im so confused about how floats work and margins and padding... whenever I try to use these rules the opposite of what I want and expect them to do seems to happen. Im kinda frustrated. I also tried using <a href="https://960.gs" target="_blank"> 960.gs </a> and it was a <em>complete</em> fail. Im going to need alot of youtube videos and stuff to kinda help me along with understanding. I kinda understand position rules too but im still a little confused. 


So, this afternoon im going to look up...

<ol>

	<li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwxGKpvW8Zk" target="_blank"> what is floats and how to they work?</a> <span class="highlight"> <----THIS IS VERY HELPFUL> </span></li> 
	<li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBJqKWXL2vg" target="_</a>">What is Relative Positioning and how does it work?</a><span class= " highlight"> <----THIS IS VERY HELPFUL></span></li>
	<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JMGG_8T-vY">What is Absolute Positioning and how does it work?</a><span class= " highlight"> <----THIS IS VERY HELPFUL></span></li>
	<li><a href=" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4xA_Olo_Uo" target="_blank"> Margins and padding</a><span class= " highlight"> <----THIS IS VERY HELPFUL></span></li>

</ol>

</p>
<p> Maybe not in that exact order...</p>

<p>Ive been working on learning Javascript for about a week now... Its been hard but Im <i>SOOO</i> happy to report that I believe that Im finally getting the hang of it...  Learning Javascript is very diffrent from leaning the basics of HTML and CSS. I was <strong>dead</strong> confused at certain parts. Like legitamatly <i>dumbfounded</i>. But Im starting to see that the diffrence between the "html/css wold" and the " Javascript world". Its all in the concepts. Conceptually, html and css is teaching you to do things visually and almost physically; whereas Javascript is moreso dealing with ideas and events. So much more cerebral. So its a totally a diffrent headsapce. However, much like html and css; you MUST learn the syntax and the language! I think this is what stummped me the most. I see now how learning the language and the syntax is implemented into getting the actions and events to bahave the way you want them to. MAN i was honestly starting to feel discouraged there for a bit... But <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/144934013X/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1">I have a new book coming on the way</a>, and I think that thats going to help me even more! Im really exited about that!   </p>

<p> My first Javascript project was getting the 'feel happy' button <a href=" index.html">on the home page of this site</a> to automatically trigger the 'happy' option in the dropdown. <i>That was really hard</i> , but only beacause I didnt understand the syntax of the language. Im super happy that I got it to work; It really makes me feel that maybe3 this isnt so complicated after all. Deffinatly a big modivation to more forward. <strong>WOW.</strong>

<h3>Hurdles</h3>

<p>So... Ive been feeling kind of unmotivated to keep learning Javascript. I know that its mainly because Im lost on alot of its praticality. I want to be able to do things to enhance my own web pages, but I dont know how Javascript plays a roll in that. I dont understand how to use javascript in a <i>practical</i> sense. I just feel like im learning ab bunch of <i> concepts </i> that dont really mean much outside of abstract thinking. Its really hard to continue learning when I dont know how the concepts are applied to anything useful. Maybe when I get to learning more about the DOM??? I dont know. I feel like im really experiencing some hurdles here.  </p>

<p> Ive got <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/144934013X/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1">Head First JavaScript </a> and its teaching me alot about functions and If's and while's; but I havent understood how they all come together to make something... This is very frustrating. I gotta keep pushing forward. But I feel incredibly lost. </p> 

<p> I found this developer named <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhnphxtsGnk&t=470s">Bree Hall</a> on youtube and I actually messaged her on Instagram. Maybe she can help me get a better understanding of things. I really hope so. Ill let you know how it goes. For now, Im going to keep reading Head First Javascript and see if things click... Wish me luck.  </p>

<p> Ive been working on code nonstop. Its fun. Its insanely furiating. When I run into problems that I dont understand, It makes me want to pull my hair out. But, when something goes right, and the elements on the page react the way I want them to; <em>expect</em> them to... Its really nice. I also am really loving the 'act' of coding. <strong>NOT</strong> nessesarily the problem solving aspect of it; but moreso the clicking and clacking of the keys aspect of it. The parts where I deffinatly <em>know</em> what im doing. Those parts are fun. Listining to lofi music and just clicking and claking away. Thats nice.... I feel like im learning alot... but, I know that I have so much to learn, and that scares me.</p> 
 
<p>
I took a little break from JavaScript. I found that my understanding of CSS needed more work. That hurt a little... but im glad that im still progressing. I think later today (or tonight because im deffinatly taking a nap), im going  to hop back into learning JS. I need to really start pouring more time and energy into learning that because I know its alot. But its just all so much. I can see how I could spend months and months <em>just</em> learning CSS... The challenge is dividing my time so that Im learning diffrent languages but not spending too much time away from my other diciplines...Its alot. its so much. Im afraid. but it also feels nice in a subtle way. But yeah, things have been good.

<p> Im learning a bit more about Javascript. I think im getting it. Im slowly starting to understand the syntax of the language and how it all comes togeter. I created a small <a href="https://codepen.io/TuscannyCodes/pen/PobEXgZ">"to-do list"</a> project that really helped me understand what Javascript was all about. Yeah, it was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttf3CEsEwMQ&t=316s">based on a tutorial that I found on Youtube</a> , but doing it helped. Its not compleatly finished yet, and im still working on it but im almost done. I think the biggest part was just learning how Javascript attateches to HTML elements. That was really confusing for me at firs, but now Im seeing that you can do certain things by using the 'getElementById'. Im seeing that you can basically grab elements from your HTML (by using classes and ID's)  and turn them into variables and use those variabls in functions to get the classes and Id's to do things via the JS code. I think one of the things that is majorly confusing is just not nessesarily knowing the Javascript commands and stuff. So, basaically there will be things that I may want to do or understand how to, and I wont understand how to do it not because I compleatly dont understand how, (well kinda) but moreso because I dont know all the Javascript functions that I need to get things done. This is also true for doing things in CSS... But I guess that all comes with time... Anywho...
</p>

<p> Im thinking about how I can restyle this page to make it more attractive. But I basically want this page to fit into my innevitable 'portfolio style' site that I make. So i guess I'll have to wait to do that type of styling until I really settle on how my portfolio will look. But yeah. Learninig more about Javascript is fun. I cant wait until Im really feeling good about it all. Looking forward to when I really feel confident in my capabilities.</p>

<h3>Maybe im just in a bad mood today.</h3>

<p>This is the most frustrated ive been since starting this process... It's like I cant even do one single thing for myself in JavaScript. Or really code in general. Something alsways goes wrong. I woke up today and wanted to do a little, <i>tiny</i> bit of writing in Javascript by myself. Do something that was not compleatly on the rails of a tutorial or a guide. And I feel that with no help at all im compleatly a wreck. Nothing worked. And the most frustrating part about it is that it <i>seems</i> like it should work. I have no idea what im doing wrong. Feeling <strong>VERY</strong> discouraged. </p>

<p> I know that this is all a part of the process...</p>


<p>Maybe im being incredibly impatient. Maybe im rushing the process. Maybe I need to go back and reasses my expectations. I dont know what it is. But all I know is that It dosent feel good to be mentally stumbling aroung in the dark for weeks on a subject.... Maybe im just in a bad mood today.  </p>

<h1>Mar 10 2021</h1>

<p>I havent learned much since the last entry. But I have learned a bit. I fiqured out how to do a few things. Im also seeing how precice I have to be when codeing. sometimes I get really frustrated but in reality, Im very close to what I want to acheieve with the code but the reason its not working is a misplaces semicolon or comma. Sometimes its just a matter of thinking I need a certain element of my code when I really need another. Im learning that code has to be SUPER precise. I mean, thats a no brainer. But its still something that i guess i needed to experience first hand. Im really hard on myself when it comes to this coding stuff. but i need to really learn how to loosen up and just enjoy the ride.   </p>

<h1> Mar 15 2021</h1>

<p>I really feel like im learning more about Javascript now. The thing is, 
Theres so much to know and its really hard to learn or build something when you dont know what the methods are to do what youre trying to do. Does that make sense? Well, I finally feel like im getting the methods down right. That makes me really happy. Thigs are still pretty difficult but im getting the basics. Im starting to understand that Javascript is basically about manipulating variables in crafty ways. And the problem that I was having earlier was basically not understanding that. The gaps in my basic understanding really prevented me from getting what Javascript was all about.  </p>

<p> Even still,I believe that my understanding is basic. but, at least its an understanding, whereas before I was struggling to grasp what to even do. So basically. HTML and CSS is about using the physical tools to build things paint the things you build and Javascript is about writing the story around those elements of the things you built...or, adding <i>concepts</i> to the things you built. Or even better yet, <i>creating how those things you built interact with themselves and one another.</i> VERY ABSTRACT. But im getting it.</p>

<h1>Aug 20 2021</h1>

<p> SO... Its been a while. Ive been learning so much. To be honest, Ive learned A TON since my last post. Sudying code has been basically all Ive been doing hahaha. This journey is one that is full of upps and downs. THIS STUFF IS NOT EASY; but all in all, I can say that Ive been enjoying myself. </p>

<p>I can also say that for the most part, I had forgotten about this little blog. Ive been so much more preooccupied with other things; which is a good thing. Ive been learning so much.But im coming back here because I really do believe that keeing a journal of my coding adventures is important(plus i just like typing). Upon learning my outlook on coding has changes/ evolved. Im seeing now that I will need to probably focus on freelancing a bit more than I had initially thought... </p>
